							<p class="major">Britten Pears Arts is a pioneering music, arts and heritage charity based on the Suffolk coast at two popular, historic visitor destinations: The Red House and Snape Maltings. We emerged from the creative partnership of Benjamin Britten, one of the greatest composers of the 20th century, and his professional and personal partner, singer Peter Pears. </p>

							<p class="major">Britten and Pears shared a progressive vision for music and the arts to be useful. Our founders’ vision inspires all our activities: from work with our local communities to our national leadership roles in the fields of talent development and music for health & wellbeing. </p>

									<p>A 19th-century industrial complex, Snape Maltings was converted by Britten and Pears into one of the world's leading centres of musical performance and development and home to the internationally renowned Aldeburgh Festival. It is also known for its independent shops and galleries, and for its breath-taking backdrop of reeds, water and sky.</p>

It cares for the collections left by the two men, including their Archive which holds an extraordinary wealth of material richly documenting their lives.

							<h2>Our programme</h2>
							<p>For the time being, our world has changed in unimaginable ways, and yet, through it all, our critical focus remains the people – including our audiences, artists, young people and those living in the most challenging conditions – we exist to support. Once we emerge from this lockdown period, we know that we will need to be there for these people more than ever. If you'd like to support our work, please visit the <a href="https://snapemaltings.co.uk/support-us/">Snape Maltings website supporter pages</a> for more information. </p>

							<p>Despite the temporary pause in our public programmes, we are still working hard to develop our other work. This rich and varied activity can be seen on our <a href="https://snapemaltings.co.uk/digital-campus/">Digital Campus</a>, which reminds us of the deeply positive impact music and the arts has on people’s lives. We hope that you find plenty to enjoy here.</p>
